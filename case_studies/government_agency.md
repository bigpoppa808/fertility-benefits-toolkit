- **Challenge:** A need to improve retention rates among veteran employees, who were leaving the agency for the private sector at a high rate.

- **Testimonial:** "Our new fertility benefit has been a critical tool for retaining our veteran employees. It has shown them that we are committed to their success, both in and out of the workplace." - Agency Director
