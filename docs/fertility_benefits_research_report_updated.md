## Executive Summary

This comprehensive report analyzes the fertility benefits market as of 2025, with particular emphasis on veteran populations and implications for national security policy. Research indicates significant growth in employer adoption of fertility benefits, driven by competitive labor markets and demonstrated return on investment. The analysis reveals critical gaps in fertility care access for military personnel under current TRICARE provisions, presenting both policy challenges and business opportunities.

## Market Landscape and Current Statistics

### Employer Adoption Trends

Current market research demonstrates substantial growth in fertility benefit adoption among U.S. employers. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (2024), 42% of U.S. employers now offer fertility benefits, representing a significant increase from 30% in 2020 and 40% in 2022. This upward trajectory reflects growing recognition of fertility benefits as essential for talent attraction and retention.

Among large employers (200+ employees), fertility coverage varies by treatment type. The Kaiser Family Foundation's 2024 Employer Health Benefits Survey found that approximately 27% of large firms that offer health benefits cover in vitro fertilization (IVF) services (KFF, 2024). However, Mercer's research indicates that about 45% of large employers covered IVF in 2023, up from 22% four years earlier (Society for Human Resource Management, 2024).

### Market Size and Growth Projections

The global fertility market demonstrates robust expansion, with multiple research organizations reporting significant growth projections. Precedence Research (2025) calculates the global fertility market size at USD $39.27 billion in 2025, with forecasts reaching USD $85.53 billion by 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.03%. Towards Healthcare (2025) reports similar projections, with the market growing from $36.57 billion in 2024 to $39.88 billion in 2025, projected to reach $87.05 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 9.06%.

### Treatment Costs and Economic Impact

Current fertility treatment costs reflect both technological advances and market expansion. A single IVF cycle ranges from $12,000 to $35,000, while comprehensive surrogacy arrangements cost between $100,000 and $200,000 (Illume Fertility, 2025; Segal, 2025). These costs represent significant financial barriers for many families, underscoring the importance of employer-sponsored coverage.

## Employee Preferences and Retention Impact

### Job Mobility and Benefit Preferences

Employee surveys consistently demonstrate strong preferences for fertility benefits, with significant implications for talent retention and recruitment. Carrot Fertility's research indicates that 65% of respondents would change jobs for fertility benefits, while 72% would stay at a company longer if they had access to such benefits (Carrot Fertility, 2024). Earlier research by the same organization found that 88% of employees would switch jobs to obtain fertility benefits, highlighting the critical importance of these offerings in competitive labor markets.

### Return on Investment for Employers

Fertility benefits generate measurable returns through multiple channels. Maven Clinic's 2025 research demonstrates that modern fertility benefits represent strategic investments in workforce resilience, contributing to improved retention and reduced replacement costs. Companies implementing comprehensive fertility benefit programs report significant reductions in turnover among affected employee populations.

## Veteran-Specific Analysis and Policy Implications

### TRICARE Coverage Gaps

Current military health coverage presents significant limitations for fertility care access. TRICARE's coverage of assisted reproductive technologies remains limited, particularly for advanced treatments like IVF and surrogacy. This creates substantial disparities between military personnel and civilian federal employees, particularly given that the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program offers comprehensive fertility benefits, including IVF coverage, beginning in 2025.

**Important Note on Executive Order 14216**: While Executive Order 14216 was signed on February 18, 2025, it only directs federal agencies to develop policy recommendations within 90 days and does not mandate immediate coverage expansion.

### National Security Implications

The military recruiting and retention crisis represents a documented national security concern. The Center for a New American Security (CNAS) has identified recruitment challenges as critical national security issues (CNAS, 2024). Comprehensive fertility benefits could serve as powerful tools for improving military retention and recruitment, particularly as family-building priorities rank highly among potential service members.

### Economic Impact of Veteran Support

Providing fertility benefits to veterans generates multiple economic benefits beyond individual family outcomes. Improved retention reduces training and replacement costs, while enhanced recruitment helps address critical personnel shortages in specialized military occupations. The economic multiplier effects extend to defense contractors and military-adjacent industries that compete for veteran talent.

## Competitive Landscape and Market Players

The fertility benefits market is characterized by several leading providers offering comprehensive platforms. Progyny operates as a leading fertility benefits manager, working with employers to provide comprehensive coverage and care coordination. Carrot Fertility offers global fertility benefits with flexible, customizable plans designed for diverse organizational needs. Maven Clinic provides a comprehensive virtual platform for women's and family health, including fertility support integrated with broader reproductive health services.

## International Comparisons and Global Trends

International fertility benefit policies vary significantly, with important implications for competitive positioning. Several countries provide governmental support for fertility treatments, including Canada's Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) for fertility treatments and Australia's rebate system for IVF and assisted reproductive technologies. The United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) provides limited free IVF cycles, though with waiting lists and strict eligibility criteria.

Within the United States, state-level mandates create significant variation in coverage requirements. Seventeen states have passed laws requiring health insurers to cover infertility treatments, including Maryland, New York, and Connecticut with specific IVF coverage mandates.

## Policy Recommendations and Strategic Implications

### Federal Policy Considerations

The research supports consideration of federal tax incentives for employers offering comprehensive fertility benefits. A 35% federal tax credit could encourage broader adoption while generating positive fiscal returns through improved workforce participation and reduced healthcare costs over time.

### State-Level Opportunities

State governments can implement complementary policies, including 25% tax credits for employer fertility benefit programs and expanded mandate coverage for fertility treatments. These policies create competitive advantages for states in attracting businesses and skilled workers.

### Research Framework

Independent policy research by Haotian Bai provides credible foundation for advocacy efforts supporting expanded fertility benefit access. The research focus on economic opportunity and human flourishing aligns with fertility benefit policy goals, while maintaining academic rigor enhances policy recommendation effectiveness.

## Conclusions and Future Outlook

The fertility benefits market demonstrates sustained growth driven by employer recognition of strategic value and employee demand. For veteran populations, current coverage gaps represent both policy challenges and business opportunities. Comprehensive fertility benefits align with broader policy objectives including national security, economic competitiveness, and family support.

The business case for fertility benefits continues strengthening as adoption rates increase and competitive pressures intensify. Organizations implementing comprehensive programs position themselves advantageously for talent attraction and retention while supporting broader social and economic objectives.
