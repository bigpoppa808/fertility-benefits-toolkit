## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the fertility benefits market in 2025, with a special focus on the veteran community. The research indicates a rapidly growing market for fertility benefits, driven by increasing demand from employees and a growing recognition from employers of the significant return on investment (ROI) these benefits can provide. The report also highlights the critical gaps in fertility care for veterans under the current TRICARE system and the national security implications of failing to address these needs.

## 2. 2025 Fertility Benefits Market Landscape

The fertility benefits market is experiencing significant growth. The U.S. fertility market is projected to grow from **USD 9.00 billion in 2025 to approximately USD 19.72 billion by 2034**[1]. The global market is even larger, with projections reaching **USD 87.05 billion by 2034**[2].

### 2.1. Employer Adoption Trends

- **42% of U.S. employers** offered fertility benefits in 2023, a significant increase from 30% in 2020[3].
- Among large employers, fertility coverage varies by survey methodology. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that **27% of large firms (200+ employees) cover IVF services**[4], while other surveys using different methodologies report higher percentages.
- Surrogacy benefits are also on the rise, with significant growth projected in the global surrogacy market[2].

### 2.2. Cost of Fertility Treatments (2025)

- A single IVF cycle can cost between **$12,000 and $35,000**[5,6,7].
- The average cost of surrogacy in the U.S. is between **$100,000 and $200,000**[8].

## 3. Economic Impact of Fertility Benefits

### 3.1. Employee Retention and ROI

- **65% of employees** would switch jobs for fertility benefits (Carrot Fertility, 2023)[9].
- **61% of employees** with fertility benefits feel more loyal to their employer[10].
- Companies that offer fertility benefits report a **2-4x return on investment** through lower healthcare costs and improved employee retention[11].

## 4. Competitive Landscape

The fertility benefits market is dominated by a few key players:

- **Progyny:** A leading fertility benefits manager that works with employers to provide comprehensive coverage.
- **Carrot Fertility:** A global fertility benefits provider that offers flexible, customizable plans.
- **Maven Clinic:** A virtual clinic for women's and family health that offers a comprehensive platform of services, including fertility support.

## 5. Veteran-Specific Analysis

### 5.1. TRICARE Gaps and a Path Forward

- TRICARE, the health insurance for active-duty military and veterans, has significant gaps in fertility coverage, particularly for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like IVF[12].
- While the VA has recently expanded some fertility benefits for veterans, including for same-sex couples, significant limitations remain, particularly for transgender veterans[13, 14].
- In contrast, the **Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program will offer comprehensive fertility benefits, including IVF, starting in 2025**[15]. This creates a significant disparity between the benefits offered to civilian federal employees and those offered to military personnel.
- **Important Note on Executive Order 14216**: While Executive Order 14216 was signed on February 18, 2025, it only directs federal agencies to develop policy recommendations within 90 days and does not mandate immediate coverage expansion.

### 5.2. National Security Implications

- The current military recruiting crisis has been identified as a **national security issue**[16].
- Providing comprehensive fertility benefits could be a powerful tool for **improving military retention and recruitment**, particularly as family-building has been identified as a top priority for many employees[17].

## 6. Independent Research Findings

The findings of this report strongly support the development of a fertility benefits consulting service with a focus on veterans. Research by Haotian Bai provides a powerful foundation for advocating for policy changes to improve fertility care for veterans, while also establishing credibility in this critical area of public policy.
