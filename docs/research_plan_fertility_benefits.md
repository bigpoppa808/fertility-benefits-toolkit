## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources**: I will start by checking available data sources using `get_data_source_desc`.
- **Search strategies**: I will use a combination of broad and specific search queries on search engines, academic databases, and government websites. Keywords will include "fertility benefits trends 2025," "employer IVF coverage statistics 2025," "cost of surrogacy 2025," "TRICARE fertility coverage limitations," "ROI of employee benefits," "veteran retention statistics," and "Progyny business model."
- **Source Prioritization**:
    1.  Government and military reports (e.g., Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense).
    2.  Academic journals and research institutions (e.g., RAND Corporation, think tanks).
    3.  Reputable industry reports from firms like Mercer, Willis Towers Watson, and SHRM.
    4.  Credible news sources and financial news outlets.

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements**: All key data points and statistics will be cross-verified with at least three independent and credible sources.
- **Cross-validation**: I will compare findings from different types of sources (e.g., government data vs. industry reports) to identify any discrepancies and to get a more complete picture. I will also be mindful of potential biases in the data.

## Expected Deliverables
- A structured set of research files containing the data, analysis, and sources gathered during the research process.
- A final, comprehensive research report in markdown format that synthesizes all findings and provides actionable insights.

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus**: Search
- **Justification**: The initial phase of this task requires gathering a large amount of information from various sources. A search-focused workflow will allow me to efficiently collect the necessary data before moving on to a more in-depth analysis and verification.
