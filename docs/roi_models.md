# ROI Calculation Models for Fertility Benefits

## 1. Simple ROI Model

This model provides a basic framework for calculating the return on investment for a fertility benefits program.

**Formula:**

```
ROI = [(Financial Gains - Cost of Program) / Cost of Program] * 100
```

**Variables:**

- **Financial Gains:** This can include cost savings from lower employee turnover, reduced healthcare costs (e.g., fewer high-risk pregnancies), and increased productivity.
- **Cost of Program:** This includes the direct costs of the fertility benefits program, such as the fees paid to a vendor (e.g., Progyny, Carrot) and the cost of treatments covered.

**Example:**

- **Assumptions:**
    - A company with 1,000 employees implements a fertility benefits program at a cost of $500,000 per year.
    - The company estimates that the program will reduce employee turnover by 2%, saving $750,000 per year.
    - The program also leads to a reduction in healthcare costs of $250,000 per year.
- **Calculation:**
    - **Financial Gains:** $750,000 (turnover savings) + $250,000 (healthcare savings) = $1,000,000
    - **ROI:** [($1,000,000 - $500,000) / $500,000] * 100 = **100%**

## 2. Comprehensive ROI Model

This model provides a more detailed approach to calculating ROI, taking into account a wider range of factors.

**Formula:**

```
ROI = [(Total Value of Benefits - Total Cost of Program) / Total Cost of Program] * 100
```

**Variables:**

- **Total Value of Benefits:**
    - **Direct Cost Savings:**
        - Reduced employee replacement costs.
        - Lower healthcare costs (e.g., managed IVF cycles, reduced NICU admissions).
        - Decreased absenteeism.
    - **Indirect Value:**
        - Increased employee productivity and engagement.
        - Improved brand reputation and attractiveness to talent.
        - Enhanced diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
- **Total Cost of Program:**
    - Vendor fees.
    - Cost of treatments.
    - Administrative costs.

**Data Points to Collect:**

To use this model, you will need to collect data on the following:

- Employee turnover rates before and after implementing the program.
- The cost of recruiting, hiring, and training new employees.
- Healthcare claims data, including costs for fertility treatments, high-risk pregnancies, and NICU admissions.
- Employee engagement and productivity surveys.

**Note:** This is a simplified model. For a more precise calculation, it is recommended to work with a qualified actuary or benefits consultant.
